### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**BrutishGuy/BrutishGuy** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal project where I am building an extension to the hyperopt-sklearn Python package to include another robust model, Catboost as well as some neural network architectures.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to work with Google Cloud Platform to build end-to-end machine learning models to interact with data stored in Cloud SQL via BigQuery and to achieve an Automated Machine Learning solution via AutoML Tables and Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits for the purposes of automated search engine optimization (SEO) strategies
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting projects on anything ranging from optimization, deep neural architectures and Kaggle competitions!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about hyperparameter and bayesian optimization, architecture search, computer vision, and anything data science related.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Find me on LinkedIn!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy very very dark chocolate! 90% cocoa purity and above is ideal.
